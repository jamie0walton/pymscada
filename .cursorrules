# pymscada Architecture

## Core Pattern
- BusServer acts as a central hub for distributing tag values
- Multiple BusClients connect to a single BusServer
- Each tag value change is broadcast to all subscribed clients (except sender)

## Tags
- Tags are unique by name
- Tags are automatically registered with the server and assigned IDs
- Value updates flow through bus, never direct reads
- Update loops are prevented by tracking source

## Special Features
- RTA (Request-To-Application) allows client-to-client messaging
- RTA messages trigger an update of the RTA tag value
- Update of the RTA tag value depends on the particular module requirements

## Style rules
- Don't add documentation when the code is self-explanatory
- Don't add extra newlines where the linter won't complain

## Change rules
- When analyzing code usage assess actual usage and not just imports
- Keep the length of lines to a maximum of 80 characters
- Favor shorter indentation levels
- Simpler is better than complex
- Avoid nesting more than 3 levels deep
