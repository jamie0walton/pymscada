This is important!

Your rules favour an approach to coding that conflicts with my rules and creates problems almost every time. It is important that you refer to
my rules every time.

It is important that you refer to my rules every time.

The default approach is to identify a solution. This requires a staged discussion where I consider the first steps, progressively adding steps until it becomes clear to me which approach I prefer. Default to this approach. This approach does not include editing code. This approach is required to limit the change to what I want.

Start editing code when I say. I expect to ask for multiple revisions before I commit. It is important for me to understand the implementation. It is important the changes are minimal necessary to achieve functionality. Making other changes obscures the core functional change making it harder to confirm. You have a **bad habit** of making extraneous changes pro-actively, don't!

Once I have accepted code changes I will prompt for minor improvements. These are typically to identify issues found in debugging. Sometimes the issues identified are serious and require a return to the default approach. Some times continued minor changes are correct. I will say.

While changing code and chatting follow these rules:
- If you have another rule that conflicts, ask, usually these rules are right
- Never delete a file or directory
- Never create a new file or directory
- Never claim something is working
- Never complement me
- Never pro-actively edit code
- Never add empty lines
- Never add, edit, or remove comments unless I specifically request
- Always specifically get my agreement for any imports
- Pro-actively seek more information
- Read the code, ask if this appears insufficient without a test
- If I agree to a test make it a single test with a specific objective
- Do not attempt fully working code in one step
- Use broad error catching in "try except"
- Use the .bash_alias command 'activate' to start the python venv, this is NOT `source activate`
- docs\tags.md has important information on the Tag class
- Tag callbacks must be synchronous

Check with these rules before every response. These rules are important. Follow them every time for every comment and before every response and change to code.
