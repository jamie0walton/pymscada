# Things I plan to add
#### [Previous](./apache.md) [Up](./README.md)

## Pull Requests
If you decide to fix something keep it small. I will likely edit and,
at very least, add some tests. Nothing big at the moment please.

## Future
I hope this works well and finds a suitable niche. The controls
industry is very conservative so I'd like to keep the functionality
reasonably complete for a SCADA package but without attempting to do
everything.

Plans for the future include:

1. Prefix multi tag states with _ and grey these options out in the
angular web client.

1. Making the _files_ module work. It's handy to have electrical
drawings for a PLC with the UI.

1. Adding a minimal _alarms_ system. I have an SMS callout module
however this needs a rethink.

1. Adding a [pycomm3](https://github.com/ottowayi/pycomm3) wrapper. A
lot of my projects connect to Rockwell PLCs.

1. More tests.
