## To Consider / Fix / Refactor

1. Consider adding Tag classes for each data type. i.e.
```TagInt('tagname')``` as opposed to ```Tag('tagname', int)```.

1. Improve ```pytest``` coverage and readability, always good to do.

1. Refactor ModbusMap so that the client and server have different versions, client without a data table.
